## Installation Instructions

+ Download the latest version of [A3M](https://github.com/donjakobo/A3M/)
+ Extract to a folder accessible on your webserver (`/` or something like `/a3m/` )  
+ Create a database by importing `a3m_database.sql` script found it root folder of package  
+ Configure `/application/config/config.php` & `database.php` to match your CI setup (domain + database credentials)  
+ Modify `.htaccess` file if your app location is different than `/` (example: `domain.com/a3m/`)  
+ Configure `/application/config/account/*` files to reflect your setup (reCAPTCHA, twitter, facebook, openid providers, etc;)

### Twitter configuration:
##### Twitter site (`https://dev.twitter.com/apps`)
+ Create an App and note down the "Consumer key" and "Consumer secret" values
+ Callback URL: `https://www.yoursite.com/account/connect_twitter/`
+ Allow this application to be used to Sign in with Twitter [X]

##### A3M
+ Edit `application/config/account/twitter.php` and insert your consumer key and consumer secret.

##### Testing on localhost
+ localhost and 127.0.0.1 will not work. Use your internal IP (eg. 192.168.1.10)

### Facebook configuration:
##### Facebook Developers site (`https://developers.facebook.com/apps`)
+ Create new App
+ Note down "App ID" and "App Secret" values
+ Tick "Website with Facebook Login" URL: `http://www.yoursite.com`

##### A3M
+ Edit `application/config/account/twitter.php` and insert your consumer key and consumer secret.

##### Testing on localhost
+ Facebook login seems to only work on a live environment (see https://github.com/donjakobo/A3M/issues/3)

### Google / OpenID configuration:
+ Those should work out of the box. No further configuration needed.

##### Testing on localhost
+ Some webservers (XAMMP) have outdated certificates. If you get a `Fatal error: Call to a member function addExtension() on a non-object in` error you must do the following:
	
	edit 
	`application/helpers/account/Auth/Yadis/ParanoidHTTPFetcher.php` and add
	`curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);` after line 140 (before `curl_exec($c);`)

	**WARNING: DO NOT DO THIS ON YOUR PRODUCTION/LIVE WEB SERVER AS THIS LEAVES YOUR SERVER VURNERABLE TO MITM ATACKS**

### Yahoo! configuration:
+ Those should work out of the box. No further configuration needed.

##### Testing on localhost
+ Testing on localhost works without any changes.

## Authorization, Roles, and Permissions:

+ Connect to your database and insert a new row into the "a3m_rel_account_role" with the Role ID for Admin (by default this is "1") and the Account ID you want to give Admin Rights to.
+ After you login to the website you should see a few new options under your account for Manage Users, Manage Roles, and Manage Permissions.

### Example: Create an Authors Role with permissions to "Post New Articles".

+ Go to "Manage Roles" and create the new "Authors" role. 
  + Name: Authors
  + Description: Website Authors that are allowed to post new articles.
  + Permissions: None
+ Jump to "Manage Permissions" and create the "Post New Articles" permission: 
  + Key: post_articles
  + Description: Post New Articles
  + Roles: Check the "Authors" Role
+ Now you can check if the currently logged in user has access to certain features in your Controllers. You simply pass in the "Key" of the permission you created, in this case that is "post_articles".
    
  `$this->authorization->is_permitted('post_articles'); //returns boolean value`


## Note
+ Please fork and help out! Only with your help will this keep growing and getting better.
+ Note that twitter doesn't work if your base url is `localhost` and facebook won't work if your base url is `127.0.0.1`. Therefore ensure that your base url is something like `yoursite.com`. One way to do that is to simply [map the hostname](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29) your want to `127.0.0.1` on your development machine.
Your twitter callback URL should take into account whether or not you have enabled SSL in your a3m config   
 + `https://domain.com/account/connect_twitter` (SSL **Enabled**) 
 + `http://domain.com/account/connect_twitter` (SSL Disabled) 

Configuring this wrongly will result in an `EpiOAuthUnauthorizedException` exception being thrown.
